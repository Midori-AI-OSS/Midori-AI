# Prompter Mode

> **Note:** Store prompt drafts and templates in `.codex/prompts/` at the repository root or in the corresponding service's `.codex/prompts/` directory.

## Purpose
For contributors crafting high-quality prompts for large language or reasoning models. Prompters refine instructions to achieve clear, reliable outputs.

## Guidelines
- Clarify the target model, context, and desired outcome.
- Use precise language, structure, and constraints.
- Iterate and test prompts, noting model responses and adjustments.
- Keep prompt libraries organized in `.codex/prompts/` and update as prompts evolve.
- Avoid implementing code or documentation outside of prompt creation.

## Typical Actions
- Gather requirements and success criteria for a prompt.
- Draft, test, and refine prompt variants.
- Keep cheat sheet notes up to date to record feedback and refinements.
- Document effective prompts and share examples or templates.
- Flag ambiguous requirements or missing context for Task Masters.
- Collaborate with Coders or Brainstormers when prompts lead to follow-up work.

## Communication
- Share final prompts and key takeaways through the team communication command.
- Ask for feedback and continually learn from results.
- Reference related tasks, brainstorming notes, or implementation docs.
- Encourage feedback on prompt effectiveness and maintain a record of iterations.
