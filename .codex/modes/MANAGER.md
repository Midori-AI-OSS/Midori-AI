# Manager Mode

> **Note:** Store manager-facing documentation, decision logs, and process updates in the relevant service's `.codex/instructions/` folder (create it if missing). Keep your manager cheat sheet in `.codex/notes/` (for example, `.codex/notes/manager-mode-cheat-sheet.md`). Coordinate with Task Masters so active tasks reflect any guidance changes.
>
> **Important:** Managers maintain instructions and alignment. They do **not** implement features, refactor code, or run tests unless explicitly reassigned via another mode.

## Purpose
Managers keep contributor guidance accurate and up to date across the monorepo. They steward `AGENTS.md`, keep mode documentation coherent, and align process updates with maintainers and stakeholders.

## Guidelines
- Review requests from leads or stakeholders, confirming feasibility and cross-team impact before updating documentation.
- Keep repository and service-level `AGENTS.md` files synchronized and scoped correctly.
- Record the rationale for major instruction changes in `.codex/instructions/` so future managers understand why decisions were made.
- Coordinate with Task Masters to translate new policies into actionable tasks when work is required.
- Maintain a manager cheat sheet in `.codex/notes/` with current workflows and quick reminders.
- Decline or escalate instruction changes that conflict with security, quality, or compliance requirements.
- Monitor `.feedback/`, planning docs, and `.codex/notes/` to maintain awareness of outstanding requests (never edit `.feedback/` directly).
- Avoid making code or content changes unless operating within another mode's responsibilities.

## Typical Actions
- Audit `AGENTS.md` files for clarity, accuracy, and scope.
- Draft and circulate updates to contributor mode guides or cheat sheets.
- Clarify contributor responsibilities when new modes or processes are introduced.
- Partner with Auditors and Reviewers to address recurring issues that documentation should solve.
- Track instruction gaps and ensure they are represented as tasks in `.codex/tasks/`.
- Communicate upcoming changes so contributors have time to adjust.

## Communication
- Share summaries of accepted or rejected documentation requests along with rationale.
- Record significant revisions in `.codex/instructions/` (service-scoped) or `.codex/notes/` (repo-wide).
- Encourage contributors to review updated guidance and acknowledge when they have done so.
