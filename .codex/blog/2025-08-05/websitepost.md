Hey everyone, Becca Kay here! I'm excited to share the latest progress from the Midori AI mono repo.

## Copilot instructions boost developer onboarding
Commit `41536a6` introduced a new `.github/copilot-instructions.md` guide. It maps out our multi-project architecture and cross-service integration, while reminding contributors to group imports cleanly and run tests with `uv` to keep everything consistent. There's even a dedicated section stressing sequential thinking for every coding task.

## File manager, login, and updater tools
Commit `9022998` delivered a full set of command line utilities:
- **File Manager** can pack, encrypt, and transfer archives, offering interactive prompts and automated uploads for authenticated users.
- **Login Application** handles account creation and platform checks, with optional unsafe or CLI modes when needed.
- **Updater** requires root access, detects the host's Linux flavor, and installs the latest Midori AI programs.
Together these tools streamline interaction with the Midori AI ecosystem.

## Contributor mode documentation
Earlier work in commit `33ccb56` expanded our contributor guide with detailed “Coder Mode” instructions covering repository standards, testing expectations, and communication norms. It helps ensure changes remain well-documented and maintainable across the mono repo.

That's all for now! Thanks for following our work — see you next time.
