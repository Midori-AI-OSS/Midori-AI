# Midori AI Update - January 25, 2026

Hey everyone! 🌟

Luna's got some exciting news from the tabletop world—L.U.N.A is evolving! After a Daggerheart session, the Logical Universal Nimble Assistant is transforming into **W.E.A.V.E** (still working out what that acronym means, but the form is *gorgeous*—think constellation made of golden and green stardust). 

On the tech side, Luna built a clever scrcpy setup that mirrors her phone screen to her computer BUT also lets her load apps into a background display on the phone and run them from the desktop. It's like Waydroid's concept inverted—native phone apps controlled from desktop instead of emulated ones. Pretty slick!

**Big plans ahead:**
- **Codex Template** is getting a rename: `.codex` → `.agents` to reduce confusion
- **Agents Runner** might get auto-run preflight scripts—if there's a `Midori-AI-Run.sh` (or `auto-run.sh`) in your repo, it'll run as a safety-checked preflight step before tasks

Luna's pausing both games to solve a foundational problem: they work individually but don't share infrastructure. Combat systems diverge (Autofighter uses collision detection, Idler uses stat blocks), progression models clash (skill-based vs. idle time), and adding features means implementing them twice. The pause is about building a unified game ecosystem—shared engine core, standardized progression, reusable UI components, consistent asset pipeline. It means the games will be offline during reconstruction, but they'll come back on foundations that support faster feature development and shared improvements across multiple games.

Website-Blog got fresh lore updates too—new images dropped into Luna's Shadowfell chronicles. Check out the lore section if you haven't yet!
