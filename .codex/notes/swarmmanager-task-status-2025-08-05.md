# Swarm Manager Log - Task Status (August 5, 2025)

## Criteria for DONE
- Task shows green and red diff numbers (e.g., +180 -4)
- Task does NOT show a spinner in the main menu

## Criteria for DOING
- Task shows status (e.g., 'Working on your task')
- Task shows number with spinner

## Current Task Status (as of now)
- **Investigate lag in React app**: DONE (+180 -4, no spinner)
- **Coder, review task order and plan implementation**: PENDING (multiple subtasks, all with 'Start task' buttons, no spinner or diff numbers)

No tasks are currently DOING. All findings are based on the current state of the Codex main tasks menu and detailed task view, following the Swarm Manager persona and workflow.
