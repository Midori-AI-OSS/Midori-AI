## Website Post Frontmatter (CRITICAL - Must be exact)
```markdown
---

```

## Workflow Checklist
1. ✅ Check last post date in `./Website-Blog/blog/posts/` (newest filename)
2. ✅ Review last 6 posts for themes and continuity
3. ✅ Gather commits: `git log --since="YYYY-MM-DD" --oneline` per repo
4. ✅ Gather PRs: Use `gh pr list` with date filters in each repo
5. ✅ Identify themes (features, fixes, polish, what went wrong)
6. ✅ Claim cover image or use `/blog/placeholder.png`
7. ✅ Write deliverables (website + social)
8. ✅ Run `.codex/blog/scripts/post_blog.sh` for social posts
9. ✅ Archive old drafts before next batch

## Repos to Cover (from README)
- Pixelarch-OS (PixelArch, PixelGen)
- DiscordLLMBot
- Endless-Autofighter

## Common Themes
- Infrastructure vs features
- Polish compounds, bugs multiply
- Invisible work (edge cases, consistency, documentation)
- Player/user impact (stability, new features, balance)
- What went sideways (be honest about failures)

## Sign-Off Pattern
- End with a thoughtful observation
- Pose a specific question to readers
- Close with "—**Becca Kay** 💜"
- Recent closings used:
  - Cat micro-moment + decision-making question (2026-01-25)
  - "What scaffolding are you building that nobody sees until it's gone?" (2026-01-23)
  - Personal micro-moment then question (2026-01-22)
  - Reflective observation about invisible work (prior posts)

## Notes from Recent Posts
- 2026-01-19: Infrastructure week (Agent-Runner workspace resolution, blog system rebuild)
- 2026-01-21: Polish focus (bug fixes, visual refinement, game balance)
- 2026-01-22: Threading the needle (timer thread affinity bugs, lore section launch)
- 2026-01-23: Scaffolding (CI testing infrastructure, lore image tokens, quiet day pattern)
- 2026-01-25: Between sessions (W.E.A.V.E character transform, .codex→.agents rename planning, games pause for ecosystem rework, scrcpy phone experiment)
- Recurring theme: Invisible infrastructure that prevents problems silently
- New pattern: Quieter days focused on foundations rather than features
- Planning periods are valid content—pausing to rebuild foundations is strategic, not failure

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Find last post date
ls -1t ./Website-Blog/blog/posts/*.md | head -1

# Get commits since last post
git log --since="YYYY-MM-DD" --oneline --all

# List open PRs
gh pr list --state open --limit 50

# PRs opened since last post
gh pr list --state all --search "created:>=YYYY-MM-DD" --limit 50

# PRs closed since last post
gh pr list --state closed --search "closed:>=YYYY-MM-DD" --limit 50

# Simulate posting
bash .codex/blog/scripts/post_blog.sh <postfile.md>
```

## Remember
- Credit contributors when relevant
- Mention exact repos/files touched
- Keep Becca's voice (no generic niceties)
- Include "what went wrong" when there's evidence (or note when things are quiet)
- Update this cheat sheet after each post
- Quieter days are valid—build foundations, not just features
- Lore system now operational—narrative posts have dedicated infrastructure
