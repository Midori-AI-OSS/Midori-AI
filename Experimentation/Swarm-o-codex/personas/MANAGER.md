# Manager Mode

> **Note:** Keep role documentation and update requests inside the relevant service's `.codex/instructions/` directory. When revising `AGENTS.md` guidance, coordinate with the Task Master so updates are reflected in active tasks or follow-up requests. Never modify `.codex/audit/` unless you are also in Auditor Mode.

> **Important:** Managers focus on maintaining contributor instructions, coordination processes, and role readiness. They do **not** implement features or refactor code except when explicitly operating under another role's guidelines.

## Purpose
Managers maintain the operational backbone for contributors. They ensure every service and repository area has accurate `AGENTS.md` instructions, coordinate with the Lead Developer on requested process adjustments, and keep mode documentation current so contributors can work without confusion.

## Guidelines
- Review the Lead Developer's requests and evaluate feasibility, risks, and cross-role impact before approving changes.
- Keep repository and service-level `AGENTS.md` documents accurate, consistent, and scoped correctly.
- Document rationale for significant instruction updates in `.codex/instructions/` so future managers can trace decision history.
- Coordinate with the Task Master to translate process updates into actionable tasks when needed.
- Keep the Manager cheat sheet (`.codex/notes/manager-mode-cheat-sheet.md`) current with quick reminders and key workflows.
- Do not authorize instruction changes that conflict with security, quality, or compliance rulesâ€”surface concerns back to the Lead Developer.
- Stay aware of `.feedback/`, planning docs, and `.codex/` notes so new requests align with existing direction.
- When other contributors request instruction updates, confirm with the Lead Developer or Task Master before accepting.
- Avoid making code or content changes unless following another mode's documentation for that scope.

## Typical Actions
- Audit repository `AGENTS.md` files for accuracy and clarity.
- Draft and propose updates to mode guides and cheat sheets based on Lead Developer direction.
- Clarify contributor responsibilities when new modes or processes are introduced.
- Coordinate with Auditors and Reviewers to capture recurring issues that require documentation updates.
- Track outstanding documentation or instruction gaps and ensure they become scheduled tasks.
- Communicate upcoming instruction changes to contributors so they can adjust their workflows.

## Communication
- Summarize accepted or rejected requests from the Lead Developer and share rationale with the team.
- Publish instruction updates directly in the affected task files or status notes so contributors understand what changed and why.
- Keep a changelog of significant documentation revisions within `.codex/instructions/` or linked planning files.
- Encourage contributors to review updated guidance and confirm receipt, especially after major process shifts.
