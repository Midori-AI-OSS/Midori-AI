# Newer “bullet heaven / horde survival” games to study (for a *stationary* main character + deep in-run builds + deep metaprogression)

## What you’re trying to build (tight definition)
- **Core loop:** character(s) stay in (roughly) one place → **auto-fire / auto-cast** → enemies **swarm** until you die.
- **Deep in-run progression:** frequent level-ups, weapon evolutions, stacking synergies, rerolls/shops, “build identity” by minute ~5.
- **Deep metaprogression:** unlock trees, permanent stats, new characters/weapons/maps/modifiers, difficulty layers that meaningfully change runs.

## Closest matches to “you stay still / single base” (study these first)

1) **Bulletmancer**
- **Why it fits:** explicitly “you don’t move, but you do shoot” — you’re basically a spell-turret.
- **In-run depth:** spell combos + corruption/region selections = lots of build space.
- **Meta depth:** upgrades/maps/characters + a glyph/stat system between runs.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** make “positioning” a *build* decision (range/arcs/chain rules) instead of a movement skill.

2) **Heretic’s Fork**
- **Why it fits:** essentially a **single tower** in the center; no movement; horde management via systems.
- **In-run depth:** deckbuilding-ish choices replace traditional “VS level-up” UI.
- **Meta depth:** unlocks + challenges; easy to add long-term goals without bloating moment-to-moment inputs.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** if you remove movement, your “skill expression” can live in *drafting* and *timing*.

3) **Towerful Defense: A Rogue TD**
- **Why it fits:** you “control a single tower” vs enemies from all directions.
- **In-run depth:** skills/traits/items craft builds (roguelike TD + bullet heaven pacing).
- **Meta depth:** expand towers/skills/traits pools; difficulty tiers.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** treat weapons like “equipment slots” with hard constraints (4 skills, etc.) → forces distinct builds.

4) **Genome Guardian**
- **Why it fits:** described as a roguelite **turret shooter** with “combine weapons” depth.
- **In-run depth:** turrets/perks/mutations/power-ups → lots of combinatorics.
- **Meta depth:** multiple modes + huge unlock surface (great reference for long-term retention).
- **Steal-worthy twist:** alternate modes (classic arena vs shmup-ish) keep the same progression backbone but refresh feel.

## Great “survivors-like” references (movement-heavy, but excellent build/meta patterns)

5) **Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor**
- **Why it’s relevant:** strong “mission/objective” structure layered on bullet-heaven chaos.
- **In-run depth:** “overclock” style upgrades that *change how weapons behave* (not just bigger numbers).
- **Meta depth:** persistent unlocks + new missions/maps; a clear content roadmap feel.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** objectives = natural pacing beats for shops/bosses/biome swaps (even if your player stays still).

6) **Boons & Burdens**
- **Why it’s relevant:** very synergy-forward spell schools; “risk bar” pressure.
- **In-run depth:** upgrades that buff categories (e.g., “beam” buffs all beams) → builds snap into identity fast.
- **Meta depth:** multiple modes with different structure.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** global-tag synergies (“anything with tag X”) are perfect for stationary games because they replace positional mastery.

7) **Picayune Dreams**
- **Why it’s relevant:** blends “auto-shoot” feel with bullet-hell-ish boss moments.
- **In-run depth:** faster scaling, targets/route choices, weird items.
- **Meta depth:** narrative/unlocks structure supports longer-term play.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** “enemies shoot back” is a clean way to add difficulty when the player can’t dodge via movement.

8) **Spirit Hunters: Infinite Horde**
- **Why it’s relevant:** classic “combine abilities to carve through hordes” structure.
- **In-run depth:** fast stacking power curve; big enemy variety loop.
- **Meta depth:** works as a template for permanent growth + unlock cadence.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** “become broken fast” is a retention engine—just gate it behind smart difficulty layers.

9) **Maze Mice**
- **Why it’s relevant:** time-freezing twist on the bullet-heaven formula (pacing control).
- **In-run depth:** route decisions + upgrades; natural “micro-turns” for build choices.
- **Meta depth:** roguelite structure supports long-term unlock layering.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** time manipulation can replace movement skill (perfect for stationary protagonists).

10) **Neon Spellstorm**
- **Why it’s relevant:** modern bullet-heaven release with a clear roguelite framing.
- **In-run depth:** spell/upgrade stacking typical of the genre.
- **Meta depth:** supports long-tail unlock loops across platforms.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** platform breadth often forces clearer UI/controls—good reference if you want “one-hand playable.”

11) **Night Swarm**
- **Why it’s relevant:** bullet-heaven combat merged with **base-building** vibes.
- **In-run depth:** leveling + boss fights; “defend vs endless” energy.
- **Meta depth:** base systems are a natural sink for permanent progression.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** base-building gives stationary gameplay a *purpose* beyond “don’t die.”

12) **Brewed and Battered**
- **Why it’s relevant:** “ingredient combinations → custom weapons” (very build-crafting-forward).
- **In-run depth:** combinatorial crafting is basically infinite build variety if tuned well.
- **Meta depth:** rescuing/unlocking systems add long-term goals.
- **Steal-worthy twist:** crafting loops can be your “movement replacement”: instead of dodging, you optimize your brew mid-run.

13) **Pesticide Not Required**
- **Why it’s relevant:** adds farming/life-sim style economy to horde survival.
- **In-run depth:** runs gain texture via side systems (planting/buying/upgrading).
- **Meta depth:** economy systems are naturally meta-friendly (unlocks, upgrades, new seeds/tools).
- **Steal-worthy twist:** “grow your weapons” is a clean metaphor for stationary power scaling.
